  "description": "A busy hospital has a list of patients waiting to see a doctor. The waitlist is created sequentially (e.g. patients are added in a fifo order) from the time the patient calls.  Once there is an availability, the front desk calls each patient to offer the appointment in the order they were added to the waitlist. The staff member from the front desk has noticed that she wastes a lot of time trying to find a patient from the waitlist since they&#39;re often not available, don&#39;t pick up the phone, etc.  She would like to generate a better list that will increase her chances of finding a patient in the first few calls.",
